This study investigates whether subjective pedagogical labels (particularly timbre) can be predicted from acoustic features in a longitudinal dataset of classical singers. Using an institutional database of student evaluations and recordings, we trained CNN and MLP models on mel spectrograms and MFCCs to classify vocal characteristics.

CNN models on Mel Spectrograms → limited accuracy

MLP models on MFCCs → statistically significant results in predicting:

Timbre (binary and three-level)

Gender

Voice group

Nasality
